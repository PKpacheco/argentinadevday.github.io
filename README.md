# Argentina DevDay 2017 

# Based in Project Zeppelin / GDG DevFest 2014 site template

## About 
Project Zeppelin allows you to setup awesome GDG DevFest site in 5 minutes. 

Project is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your website from GitHubâ€™s servers for free. [Learn more about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Template is brought by [GDG Lviv](http://lviv.gdg.org.ua/) team.

### Quick-start guide
1. [Fork](https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin/fork) this repo
2. Clone locally
3. Update ```_config.yml``` 
4. Select what content blocks do you need
5. Push changes to ```gh-pages``` branch
6. Enjoy your awesome DevFest site at ```http://[your github name].github.io/zeppelin/```


## Local development

Check if you have [all requirements for local environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
To install all development dependencies install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
```bash
    gem install bundler
``` 
and run next command from root folder:

```bash
  bundle install
```  

To start Jekyll run:
```bash
    jekyll serve -w
```
Site will be available at http://127.0.0.1:4000/zeppelin/ or http://localhost:4000/zeppelin/ (on Windows)

**NOTE:** in this mode all changes to html and data files will be automatically regenerated, but after changing ```_config.yml``` you have to restart server.
